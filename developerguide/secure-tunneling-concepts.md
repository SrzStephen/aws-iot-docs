# Secure tunneling concepts<a name="secure-tunneling-concepts"></a>

The following terms are used by secure tunneling when establishing communication with remote devices\. For information about how secure tunneling works, see [How secure tunneling works](how-secure-tunneling-works.md)\.

**Client access token \(CAT\)**  
A pair of tokens generated by secure tunneling when a new tunnel is created\. The CAT is used by the source and destination devices to connect to the secure tunneling service\.

**Destination application**  
The application that runs on the destination device\. For example, the destination application can be an SSH daemon for establishing an SSH session using secure tunneling\.

**Destination device**  
The remote device you want to access\.

**Device agent**  
An IoT application that connects to the AWS IoT device gateway and listens for new tunnel notifications over MQTT\. For more information, see [IoT agent snippet](agent-snippet.md)\.

**Local proxy**  
A software proxy that runs on the source and destination devices and relays a data stream between secure tunneling and the device application\. The local proxy can be run in source mode or destination mode\. For more information, see [Local proxy](local-proxy.md)\.

**Source device**  
The device an operator uses to initiate a session to the destination device, usually a laptop or desktop computer\.

**Tunnel**  
 A logical pathway through AWS IoT that enables bidirectional communication between a source device and destination device\.
