 [Let us know what would help make it better](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forms/aws-doc-feedback?hidden_service_name=IoT%20Docs&topic_url=http://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/iot/latest/diagnosing-connectivity-issues.html) 

A successful connection to AWS IoT requires:
+ A valid connection
+ A valid and active certificate
+ A policy that allows the desired connection and operation

## Connection<a name="troubleshooting-connect"></a>

How do I find the correct endpoint?  
+ The `endpointAddress` returned by `aws iot [describe\-endpoint](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/iot/describe-endpoint.html) --endpoint-type iot:Data-ATS`

  or
+ The `domainName` returned by `aws iot [describe\-domain\-configuration](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/iot/describe-domain-configuration.html) â€“-domain-configuration-name "domain_configuration_name"`

How do I find the correct Server Name Indication \(SNI\) value?  
The correct SNI value is the `endpointAddress` returned by the [describe\-endpoint](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/iot/describe-endpoint.html) or [describe\-domain\-configuration](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/iot/describe-domain-configuration.html) commands\. It's the same address as the endpoint in the previous step\.

How do I solve a connectivity issue that persists?  
You can use AWS Device Advisor to help troubleshoot\. Device Advisor's pre\-built tests help you validate your device software against best practices for usage of [TLS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/protocols.html), [MQTT](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/protocols.html), [AWS IoT Device Shadow](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-device-shadows.html), and [AWS IoT Jobs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-jobs.html)\.  
 Here is a link to the existing [Device Advisor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/device-advisor.html) content\.

## Authentication<a name="troubleshooting-authentication"></a>

Devices must be [authenticated](client-authentication.md) to connect to AWS IoT endpoints\. For devices that use [X\.509 client certificates](x509-client-certs.md) for authentication, the certificates must be registered with AWS IoT and be active\.

How do my devices authenticate AWS IoT endpoints?  
Add the AWS IoT CA certificate to your client's trust store\. Refer to the documentation on [Server Authentication in AWS IoT Core](x509-client-certs.html#server-authentication) and then follow the links to download the appropriate CA certificate\.

What is checked when a device connects to AWS IoT?  
When a device attempts to connect to AWS IoT:  

1. AWS IoT checks for a valid certificate and Server Name Indication \(SNI\) value\.

1. AWS IoT checks to see that the certificate used is registered with the AWS IoT Account and that it has been activated\.

1. When a device attempts to perform any action in AWS IoT, such as to subscribe to or publish a message, the policy attached to the certificate it used to connect is checked to confirm that the device is authorized to perform that action\.

How can I validate a correctly configured certificate?  
Use the OpenSSL `s_client` command to test a connection to the AWS IoT endpoint:  

```
openssl s_client -connect custom_endpoint.iot.aws-region.amazonaws.com:8443 -CAfile CA.pem -cert cert.pem -key privateKey.pem
```
For more information about using `openssl s_client`, see [OpenSSL s\_client documentation](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/man1/openssl-s_client.html)\.

How do I check the status of a certificate?  
+ 

**List the certificates**  
If you don't know the certificate ID, you can see the status of all your certificates by using the `aws iot [list\-certificates](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/iot/list-certificates.html)` command\.
+ 

**Show a certificate's details**  
If you know the certificate's ID, this command shows you more detailed information about the certificate\.

  ```
  aws iot [describe\-certificate](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/iot/describe-certificate.html) --certificate-id "certificateId"
  ```
+ 

**Review the certificate in the AWS IoT Console**  
In the [AWS IoT console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot/home), in the left menu, choose **Secure**, and then choose **Certificates**\.

  Choose the certificate that you are using to connect from the list to open its detail page\.

  In the certificate's detail page, you can see its current status\.

  The certificate's status can be changed by using the **Actions** menu in the upper\-right corner of the details page\.

## Authorization<a name="troubleshooting-authorization"></a>

AWS IoT resources use [AWS IoT Core policies](iot-policies.md) to authorize those resources to perform [actions](iot-policy-actions.md)\. For an action to be authorized, the specified AWS IoT resources must have a policy document attached to it that grants permission to perform that action\.

I received a `PUBNACK` or `SUBNACK` response from the broker\. What do I do?  
Make sure that there is a policy attached to the certificate you are using to call AWS IoT\. All publish/subscribe operations are denied by default\.  
Make sure the attached policy authorizes the [actions](iot-policy-actions.md) you are trying to perform\.  
Make sure the attached policy authorizes the [resources](iot-action-resources.md) that are trying to perform the authorized actions\.

I have an *AUTHORIZATION\_FAILURE* entry in my logs\.  
Make sure that there is a policy attached to the certificate you are using to call AWS IoT\. All publish/subscribe operations are denied by default\.  
Make sure the attached policy authorizes the [actions](iot-policy-actions.md) you are trying to perform\.  
Make sure the attached policy authorizes the [resources](iot-action-resources.md) that are trying to perform the authorized actions\.

How do I check what the policy authorizes?  
In the [AWS IoT console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot/home), in the left menu, choose **Secure**, and then choose **Certificates**\.  
Choose the certificate that you are using to connect from the list to open its detail page\.  
In the certificate's detail page, you can see its current status\.  
In the left menu of the certificate's detail page, choose **Policies** to see the policies attached to the certificate\.  
Choose the desired policy to see its details page\.  
In the policy's details page, review the policy's **Policy document** to see what it authorizes\.  
Choose **Edit policy document** to make changes to the policy document\.

## Security and identity<a name="troubleshooting-security-identity"></a>

When you provide the server certificates for AWS IoT custom domain configuration, the certificates have a maximum of four domain names\. 

For more information, see [AWS IoT Core endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/iot-core.html#security-limits)\.
