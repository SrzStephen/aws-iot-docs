# Tutorial: Installing and configuring the AWS IoT Device Client<a name="iot-dc-install-dc"></a>

This tutorial walks you through the installation and configuration of the AWS IoT Device Client and the creation of AWS IoT resources that you'll use in this and other demos\.

**To start this tutorial:**
+ Have your local host computer and Raspberry Pi from [the previous tutorial](iot-dc-prepare-device.md) ready\.

This tutorial can take up to 90 minutes to complete\.

**When you're finished with this topic:**
+ Your IoT device will be ready to use in other AWS IoT Device Client demos\.
+ You'll have provisioned your IoT device in AWS IoT Core\.
+ You'll have downloaded and installed the AWS IoT Device Client on your device\.
+ You'll have saved an image of your device's microSD card that can be used in subsequent tutorials\.

**Required equipment:**
+ Your local development and testing environment from [the previous section](iot-dc-prepare-device-test.md)
+ The Raspberry Pi that you used in [the previous section](iot-dc-prepare-device-test.md)
+ The microSD memory card from the Raspberry Pi that you used in [the previous section](iot-dc-prepare-device-test.md)

**Topics**
+ [Step 1: Download and save the AWS IoT Device Client](iot-dc-install-download.md)
+ [\(Optional\) Save the microSD card image](iot-dc-install-dc-save.md)
+ [Step 2: Provision your Raspberry Pi in AWS IoT](iot-dc-install-provision.md)
