# Tutorial: Demonstrate remote actions \(jobs\) with the AWS IoT Device Client<a name="iot-dc-runjobs"></a>

In these tutorials, you'll configure and deploy jobs to your Raspberry Pi to demonstrate how you can send remote operations to your IoT devices\.

**To start this tutorial:**
+ Have your local host computer an Raspberry Pi configured as used in [the previous section](iot-dc-testconn.md)\. 
+ If you haven't completed the tutorial in the previous section, you can try this tutorial by using the Raspberry Pi with a microSD card that has the image you saved after you installed the AWS IoT Device Client in [\(Optional\) Save the microSD card image](iot-dc-install-dc-save.md)\.
+ If you have run this demo before, review [Step 2: Cleaning up your AWS account after building demos with the AWS IoT Device Client](iot-dc-cleanup.md#iot-dc-cleanup-cloud) to delete all AWS IoT resources that you created in earlier runs to avoid duplicate resource errors\.

This tutorial takes about 45 minutes to complete\.

**When you're finished with this topic:**
+ You'll have demonstrated different ways that your IoT device can use the AWS IoT Core to run remote operations that are managed by AWS IoT \.

**Required equipment:**
+ Your local development and testing environment that you tested in [a previous section](iot-dc-install-dc.md)
+ The Raspberry Pi that you tested in [a previous section](iot-dc-install-dc.md)
+ The microSD memory card from the Raspberry Pi that you tested in [a previous section](iot-dc-install-dc.md)

+ [Step 1: Prepare the Raspberry Pi to run jobs](iot-dc-runjobs-prepare.md)
+ [Step 2: Create and run the job in AWS IoT](iot-dc-runjobs-prepare-define.md)
