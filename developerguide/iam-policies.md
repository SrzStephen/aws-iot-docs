# IAM managed policies<a name="iam-policies"></a>

AWS IoT works with AWS IoT and IAM policies\. This topic discusses IAM policies only\. For more information, see [AWS IoT Core policies](iot-policies.md)\. AWS Identity and Access Management defines a policy action for each operation defined by AWS IoT, including control plane and data plane APIs\.

## IAM managed policy reference<a name="iam-managed-policies"></a>

AWS IoT provides a set of IAM managed policies you can either use as\-is or as a starting point for creating custom IAM policies\. These policies allow access to configuration and data operations\. Configuration operations allow you to create things, certificates, policies, and rules\. Data operations send data over MQTT or HTTP protocols\. The following table describes these templates\.


| Policy template | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| [AWSIoTConfigAccess](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSIoTConfigAccess$jsonEditor?section=permissions) | Allows the associated identity access to all AWS IoT configuration operations\.
