# Building solutions with the AWS IoT Device SDKs<a name="iot-tutorials-sdk-intro"></a>

The tutorials in this section help walk you through the steps to develop an IoT solution that can be deployed to a production environment using AWS IoT\.

These tutorials can take more time to complete than those in the section on [Building demos with the AWS IoT Device Client](iot-tutorials-dc-intro.md) because they use the AWS IoT Device SDKs and explain the concepts being applied in more detail to help you create secure and reliable solutions\.
