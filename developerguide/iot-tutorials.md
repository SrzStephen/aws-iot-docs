# AWS IoT tutorials<a name="iot-tutorials"></a>

The AWS IoT tutorials are divided into two learning paths to support two different goals\. Choose the best learning path for your goal\.
+ 

**You want to build a proof\-of\-concept to test or demonstrate an AWS IoT solution idea**  
To demonstrate common IoT tasks and applications using the AWS IoT Device Client on your devices, follow the [Building demos with the AWS IoT Device Client](iot-tutorials-dc-intro.md) learning path\. The AWS IoT Device Client provides device software with which you can apply your own cloud resources to demonstrate an end\-to\-end solution with minimum development\.

  For information about the AWS IoT Device Client, see the [AWS IoT Device Client](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-iot-device-client#readme)\.
+ 

**You want to learn how to build production software to deploy your solution**  
To create your own solution software that meets your specific requirements using an AWS IoT Device SDK, follow the [Building solutions with the AWS IoT Device SDKs](iot-tutorials-sdk-intro.md) learning path\.

  For information about the available AWS IoT Device SDKs, see [AWS IoT Device SDKs](iot-sdks.md#iot-device-sdks)\. For information about the AWS SDKs, see [Tools to Build on AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/tools/)\.
