Before you can stream trace messages, create a network analyzer configuration and add the resources you want to monitor to this configuration\. When you create a configuration, you can:
+ Specify a configuration name and optional description\.
+ Customize the configuration settings such as frame info and level of detail for your log messages\.
+ Add the resources that you want to monitor\. The resources can be wireless devices or wireless gateways, or both\.

The configuration settings that you specify will determine the trace messaging information that you'll receive for resources you add to the configuration\. You may also want to create multiple configurations depending on your monitoring use case\.

The following shows how to create a configuration and add resources\.
