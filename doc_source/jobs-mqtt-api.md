**Note**  
Jobs device commands can be issued by publishing MQTT messages to the [Reserved topics used for Jobs commands](reserved-topics.md#reserved-topics-job)\. Your client is automatically subscribed to the response message topics of these commands, which means that the message broker will publish response message topics to the client that published the command message whether your client has subscribed to the response message topics or not\.   
Because the message broker publishes response messages, even without an explicit subscription to them, your client must be configured to receive and identify the messages it receives\. Your client must also confirm that the *thingName* in the incoming message topic applies to the client's thing name before the client acts on the message\.  
Messages that AWS IoT sends in response to MQTT Jobs API command messages are charged to your account, whether you subscribed to them explicitly or not\.

## GetPendingJobExecutions<a name="mqtt-getpendingjobexecutions"></a>

Gets the list of all jobs for a thing that are not in a terminal state\.

**Note**  
AWS IoT publishes the response messages directly to the client that made the request, whether the client has subscribed to the response topics or not\. Clients should expect to receive the response messages even if they have not subscribed to them\. These response messages do not pass through the message broker and they cannot be subscribed to by other clients or rules\.  
Job progress messages that are processed through the message broker and can be used by AWS IoT rules are published as [Jobs events](events-jobs.md)\.

## StartNextPendingJobExecution<a name="mqtt-startnextpendingjobexecution"></a>

Gets and starts the next pending job execution for a thing \(status IN\_PROGRESS or QUEUED\)\. 
+ Any job executions with status IN\_PROGRESS are returned first\.
+ Job executions are returned in the order in which they were created\.
+ If the next pending job execution is QUEUED, its state is changed to IN\_PROGRESS and the job execution's status details are set as specified\.
+ If the next pending job execution is already IN\_PROGRESS, its status details are not changed\.
+ If no job executions are pending, the response does not include the `execution` field\.
+ You can optionally create a step timer by setting a value for the `stepTimeoutInMinutes` property\. If you don't update the value of this property by running `UpdateJobExecution`, the job execution times out when the step timer expires\.

**Note**  
AWS IoT publishes the response messages directly to the client that made the request, whether the client has subscribed to the response topics or not\. Clients should expect to receive the response messages even if they have not subscribed to them\.

## UpdateJobExecution<a name="mqtt-updatejobexecution"></a>

Updates the status of a job execution\. You can optionally create a step timer by setting a value for the `stepTimeoutInMinutes` property\. If you don't update the value of this property by running `UpdateJobExecution` again, the job execution times out when the step timer expires\.

**Note**  
AWS IoT publishes the response messages directly to the client that made the request, whether the client has subscribed to the response topics or not\. Clients should expect to receive the response messages even if they have not subscribed to them\. These response messages do not pass through the message broker and they cannot be subscribed to by other clients or rules\.  
Job progress messages that are processed through the message broker and can be used by AWS IoT rules are published as [Jobs events](events-jobs.md)\.

------
#### [ MQTT \(15\) ]

To invoke this API, publish a message on `$aws/things/thingName/jobs/jobId/update`\. 

Request payload:

```
{
"status": "job-execution-state",
"statusDetails": { 
    "string": "string"
    ...
},
"expectedVersion": "number",
"executionNumber": long,
"includeJobExecutionState": boolean,
"includeJobDocument": boolean,
"stepTimeoutInMinutes": long,
"clientToken": "string"
}
```

`status`  
The new status for the job execution \(IN\_PROGRESS, FAILED, SUCCEEDED, or REJECTED\)\. This must be specified on every update\.

`statusDetails`  
A collection of name\-value pairs that describe the status of the job execution\. If not specified, the `statusDetails` are unchanged\.

`expectedVersion`  
The expected current version of the job execution\. Each time you update the job execution, its version is incremented\. If the version of the job execution stored in the AWS IoT Jobs service does not match, the update is rejected with a `VersionMismatch` error, and an [ErrorResponse](jobs-data-plane-data-types.md#jobs-mqtt-error-response) that contains the current job execution status data is returned\. \(This makes it unnecessary to perform a separate `DescribeJobExecution` request to obtain the job execution status data\.\)

`executionNumber`  
Optional\. A number that identifies a job execution on a device\. If not specified, the latest job execution is used\.

`includeJobExecutionState`  
Optional\. When included and set to `true`, the response contains the `JobExecutionState` field\. The default is `false`\.

`includeJobDocument`  
Optional\. When included and set to `true`, the response contains the `JobDocument`\. The default is `false`\.

`stepTimeoutInMinutes`  
Specifies the amount of time this device has to finish execution of this job\. If the job execution status is not set to a terminal state before this timer expires, or before the timer is reset \(by again calling `UpdateJobExecution`, setting the status to `IN_PROGRESS` and specifying a new timeout value in this field\) the job execution status is set to `TIMED_OUT`\. Setting or resetting this timeout has no effect on the job execution timeout that might have been specified when the job was created \(by using `CreateJob` with the `timeoutConfig`\)\. 

`clientToken`  
A client token used to correlate requests and responses\. Enter an arbitrary value here and it is reflected in the response\.

The message broker will publish `$aws/things/thingName/jobs/jobId/update/accepted` and `$aws/things/thingName/jobs/jobId/update/rejected` even without a specific subscription to them\. However, for your client to receive the messages, it must be listening for them\. For more information, see [the note about Jobs API messages](#jobs-mqtt-note)\.

Response payload:

```
{
"executionState": JobExecutionState,
"jobDocument": "string",
"timestamp": timestamp,
"clientToken": "string"
}
```

`executionState`  
A [JobExecutionState](jobs-data-plane-data-types.md#jobs-mqtt-job-execution-state) object\.

`jobDocument`  
A [job document](iot-jobs.md#key-concepts-jobs) object\.

`timestamp`  
The time, in seconds since the epoch, when the message was sent\.

`clientToken`  
A client token used to correlate requests and responses\.

`thingName`  
The name of the thing associated with the device\.

`jobId`  
The unique identifier assigned to this job when it was created\.

`status`  
The new status for the job execution \(IN\_PROGRESS, FAILED, SUCCEEDED, or REJECTED\)\. This must be specified on every update\.

`statusDetails`  
Optional\. A collection of name\-value pairs that describe the status of the job execution\. If not specified, the `statusDetails` are unchanged\.

`expectedVersion`  
Optional\. The expected current version of the job execution\. Each time you update the job execution, its version is incremented\. If the version of the job execution stored in the AWS IoT Jobs service does not match, the update is rejected with a `VersionMismatch` error, and an [ErrorResponse](jobs-data-plane-data-types.md#jobs-mqtt-error-response) that contains the current job execution status data is returned\. \(This makes it unnecessary to perform a separate `DescribeJobExecution` request to obtain the job execution status data\.\)

`includeJobExecutionState`  
Optional\. When included and set to `true`, the response contains the JobExecutionState data\. The default is `false`\.

`includeJobDocument`  
Optional\. When set to `true`, the response contains the job document\. The default is `false`\.

`stepTimeoutInMinutes`  
Specifies the amount of time this device has to finish execution of this job\. If the job execution status is not set to a terminal state before this timer expires, or before the timer is reset \(by again calling `UpdateJobExecution`, setting the status to `IN_PROGRESS` and specifying a new timeout value in this field\) the job execution status is set to `TIMED_OUT`\. Setting or resetting this timeout has no effect on the job execution timeout that might have been specified when the job was created \(by using `CreateJob` with the `timeoutConfig`\)\. 

`executionNumber`  
Optional\. A number that identifies a job execution on a device\.

Response:

```
{
"executionState": JobExecutionState,
"jobDocument": "string"
}
```

`executionState`  
A [JobExecutionState](jobs-data-plane-data-types.md#jobs-mqtt-job-execution-state) object\.

`jobDocument`  
The contents of the [job document](iot-jobs.md#key-concepts-jobs)\.

## NextJobExecutionChanged<a name="mqtt-nextjobexecutionchanged"></a>

Sent whenever there is a change to which job execution is next on the list of pending job executions for a thing, as defined for [DescribeJobExecution](#mqtt-describejobexecution) with jobId `$next`\. This message is not sent when the next job's execution details change, only when the next job that would be returned by `DescribeJobExecution` with jobId `$next` has changed\. Consider job executions J1 and J2 with state QUEUED\. J1 is next on the list of pending job executions\. If the state of J2 is changed to IN\_PROGRESS while the state of J1 remains unchanged, then this notification is sent and contains details of J2\.
