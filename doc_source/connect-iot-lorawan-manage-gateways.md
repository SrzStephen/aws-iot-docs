# Managing gateways with AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN<a name="connect-iot-lorawan-manage-gateways"></a>

Gateways act as a bridge and carry LoRaWAN device data to and from a Network Server, usually over high\-bandwidth networks like Wi\-Fi, Ethernet, or Cellular\. LoRaWAN gateways connect wireless devices to AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN\.

Following are some important considerations when using your gateways with AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN\. For information about how to add your gateway to AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN, see [Onboard your gateways to AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN](connect-iot-lorawan-onboard-gateways.md)\. 

## LoRa Basics Station software requirement<a name="connect-iot-lorawan-lora-basics-station"></a>

To connect to AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN, your LoRaWAN gateway must have software called [LoRa Basics Station](https://doc.sm.tc/station) running on it\. LoRa Basics Station is an open source software that is maintained by Semtech Corporation and distributed by their [GitHub](https://github.com/lorabasics/basicstation) repository\. AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN supports LoRa Basics Station version 2\.0\.4 and later\.

## Using qualified gateways from the AWS Partner Device Catalog<a name="connect-iot-lorawan-qualified-gateways"></a>

The [AWS Partner Device Catalog](https://devices.amazonaws.com/search?page=1&sv=iotclorawan) contains gateways and developer kits that are qualified for use with AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN\. We recommend that you use these qualified gateways because you don't have to modify the embedding software for connecting the gateways to AWS IoT Core\. These gateways already have a version of the BasicStation software compatible with AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN\.

**Note**  
If you have a gateway that is not listed in the Partner Catalog as a qualified gateway with AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN, you might still be able to use it if the gateway is running LoRa Basics Station software with version 2\.0\.4 and later\. Make sure that you use **TLS Server and Client Authentication** for authenticating your LoRaWAN gateway\.

## Using CUPS and LNS protocols<a name="connect-iot-lorawan-cups-lns-protocols"></a>

LoRa Basics Station software contains two sub protocols for connecting gateways to network servers, LoRaWAN Network Server \(LNS\) and Configuration and Update Server \(CUPS\) protocols\.

The LNS protocol establishes a data connection between a LoRa Basics Station compatible gateway and a network server\. LoRa uplink and downlink messages are exchanged through this data connection over secure WebSockets\.

The CUPS protocol enables credentials management, and remote configuration and firmware update of gateways\. AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN provides both LNS and CUPS endpoints for LoRaWAN data ingestion and remote gateway management respectively\.

For more information, see [LNS protocol](https://doc.sm.tc/station/tcproto.html) and [CUPS protocol](https://doc.sm.tc/station/cupsproto.html)\.
